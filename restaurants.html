    <p>If you're looking for savory, stacked and loaded burgers and sandwiches, look no further than Sambros. Since opening in 2019, they've won multiple accolades, including Best of Ireland title at the Just Eat Awards in 2023, where it also received the Best of Munster award. The establishment also won "Best Lunch" at the Just Eat Awards in 2025.

    <p>Afro Delight is one of the most popular restaurants in Limerick for good reason. Their hearty Nigerian food is sure to leave your tastebuds stunned with the complex flavors of dishes like their Jollof rice or Egusi soup. Be sure to check their stall at the Saturday Milk Market to get a taste of Nigeria! <a href="https://share.google/ZS01a7bd7LOcfaldd">Google Maps</a>

Personal Recommendations

<div class="row paragraphs">
  <div class="column">
    <p>If I were to recommend a menu item from the popular establishment Turkmen Grill, it'd be their Lamb Doner Kebab. Takes less than 10 minutes to get it as soon as you order, and is filled with veggies, mayo and shredded Lamb. They also give you a spicy sauce to add to your shawarma if needed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <p>Mejana is the only place in Limerick you should go to for quality Lebanese food. Their falafel is nothing less than perfect, and pairs well with their hot or cold mezzes. I would also recommend their tabbouleh on the side for a fresh Lebanese salad.</p>
