									<p>Welding</p>
									
								<p>I just really like welding because making stuff is awesome and being ablt to make something with weight and sturdiness is just cool. Also making weird shit is fun.</p>
								<p>Most of the stuff I have made with welding is from an anime or game and is just weird enough that having made it and owning it is cool in and of itself. I have made stuff like the inverted spear of heaven from JJK, or Tengen Uzui's sword from demon slayer, all of which are repilcas(legally)</p>
