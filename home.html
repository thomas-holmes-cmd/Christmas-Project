    <p>A short recap of Limerick city:</p>
<p>Limerick City, located on the banks of the River Shannon in western Ireland, is a vibrant blend of rich history and modern culture. Known for landmarks like King John’s Castle and the medieval St. Mary’s Cathedral, the city offers a fascinating glimpse into Ireland’s past. At the same time, its lively arts scene, bustling markets, and growing tech presence make it a dynamic place to explore. With friendly locals, scenic riverside walks, and a unique mix of old and new, Limerick stands out as one of Ireland’s most characterful urban centers.</p>
